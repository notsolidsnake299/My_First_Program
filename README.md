# My_First_Program
hello world

#Update August 21, 2025: New minimal features, i added disk usage and memory usage i plan to improve this program fast i can :)
The noticeable changes made are:
*"Fix for the unusual program flickering"
*"Logic errors have been corrected"
*"And other minor improvements"

I plan to add more functionality in the future, which I won't mention for now.

For now, this is a demo program. As I continue to learn, I'll add more features, but I'll keep them simple for the time being.
this program is a demo, As i learn, I will add some things (and minimal things while i'm learning)

login is the first main of the code, questions is the 2nd module, and, the third program is a separate module for other purposes (like task manager).
