# August 27, 2025 Update: More Minimal Features and Improvements for tskm.py

Hello World!

 Features and Improvements
1. I've made some noticeable changes to the program tskm.py:

   - I've added a list of processes (that are running on your computer), their usage percentages, and their PIDs, more PIDs.
   - Select and Kill are added
   - Fixed the lag and delay problems

2.Additional notes:

The program is still imperfect, so I'll keep improving it as fast as I can. Once it's done, you can use it! :D 
Feel free to use the code as a base for your own task manager.

I plan to add more functionality in the future, which I won't mention
