#August 22, 2025 Update: Minimal Features and Improvements

 -"I've made some noticeable changes to the program:"

 -"Fixed unusual flickering: The issue causing the screen to flicker has been resolved."

 -"Corrected logic errors: Several logical bugs in the code have been fixed."

 -"Minor improvements: Other small enhancements have been implemented"

 -"Task manager: The program now includes a task manager feature. Currently, it only shows one process, but I plan to fix this so it displays the top 10 processes."

I'm working on improving this program as fast as I can.

I plan to add more functionality in the future, which I won't mention for now.

For now, this is a demo program. As I continue to learn, I'll add more features, but I'll keep them simple for the time being.
this program is a demo, As i learn, I will add some things (and minimal things while i'm learning)

login is the first main of the code, questions is the 2nd module, and, the third program is a separate module for other purposes (like task manager).
